# BFBrain

[Installation](#installation) | [Documentation/Tutorial](https://bfbrain.readthedocs.io) | [Examples](https://github.com/Gwojci03/BFBrain/tree/main/examples)

Use active learning to determine the bounded-from-below region in parameter space of a multiscalar potential in quantum field theory.

## Installation

Note that it is highly recommended that BFBrain only be run on a machine with Tensorflow and Jax both installed with full GPU support. Once these installations are completed, install BFBrain with the command:

```bash
$ pip install bfbrain
```
